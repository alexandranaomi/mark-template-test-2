### What are design tokens?

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

#### Salesforce, [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/#openInNewTab)

The term "design token" was created by the Salesforce design system team in 2014.

Design tokens are variables that store visual design attributes, such as colors and typography, which can be used to style and build cross-platform User Interfaces (UI). They are the tiniest element of a design system and represent repeated design decisions.

Design tokens have meaningful names to reflect visual styles in an agnostic way, instead of using hard-coded values. This allows them to be exported in a variety of formats and to be used in various design and development tools, whether to build an Android, iOS, software or web application.
